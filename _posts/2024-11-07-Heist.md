## Summary
Heist is an easy difficulty Windows box with an “Issues” portal accessible on the web server, from
which it is possible to gain Cisco password hashes. These hashes are cracked, and subsequently
RID bruteforce and password spraying are used to gain a foothold on the box. The user is found
to be running Firefox. The firefox.exe process can be dumped and searched for the
administrator’s password.

## Initial reconnaissance
I will begin by conducting an Nmap service and version scan using default scripts. This will help identify any open ports that I can target for further exploration.

> Always save the Nmap output in a text file for future reference. This practice is invaluable, as repeatedly running Nmap can be time-consuming and unnecessary.

Looking like we have an IIS Website running on `port 80`. Let's see what we got there
