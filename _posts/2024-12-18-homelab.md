## About

So, most of the machines that I practice on hack-the-box are made vulnerable deliberately and all that we need to do mostly is find misconfiguration, abuse those misconfigurations, and then pawn the machine. The entire process usually involves recon, initial foothold, lateral movement (sometimes), and then finally privilege escalation capturing the root flag. These machines usually have a pre-decided attack paths by the authors. But in a real world scenario, there can be multiple attack paths, and sometimes the machines are hardened and protected so much that getting the initial foothold itself becomes a very big challenge. I mean many machines that I pawned did not even have defender enabled, forget about additional anti-virus. Do you really expect to see an environment like that in real life with no firewall, no GPO hardening (at least MS baselines?) no IDS/IDR, Security information and event management (SIEM), etc.?
What I am trying to say is, most likely using the techniques learned in hack the box, we might get caught during the initial passive recon phase itself. But that does not make hack-the-box bad, and it is still one of the best platforms to learn hacking, but what I am trying to do here is simulate a real world scenario wherein I have to a lot of work before I can successfully penetrate a network.
