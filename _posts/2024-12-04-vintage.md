### Port scanning

I'll start by running an Nmap service and version scan with the default scripts. This will help identify any open ports and provide information about the services running on them, giving us valuable targets for further exploration.
> Always save the Nmap output in a text file for future reference. This practice is invaluable, as repeatedly running Nmap can be time-consuming and unnecessary.

After reviewing the Nmap scan results, we can confidently deduce that the target is a Domain Controller. This is evident from the presence of port `88/tcp`, which is commonly associated with [Kerberos authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview).

### SMB Enumeration

Using the credentials already provided, we are going to check if there are any interesting SMB shares using `netexec`.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/vintage]
└─$ netexec smb 10.129.102.227 -u P.Rosa -p 'Rosaisbest123' --shares     
SMB         10.129.102.227  445    10.129.102.227   [*]  x64 (name:10.129.102.227) (domain:10.129.102.227) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.102.227  445    10.129.102.227   [-] 10.129.102.227\P.Rosa:Rosaisbest123 STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED
```
Interstingly, the credentials did not work and we got `STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` message. let's try `LDAP` this time just to verify that the credentials were correct.

```shell
┌──(frodo㉿kali)-[~/hack-the-box/vintage]
└─$ netexec ldap  10.129.102.227 -u P.Rosa -p 'Rosaisbest123'     
LDAP        10.129.102.227  389    dc01.vintage.htb [*]  x64 (name:dc01.vintage.htb) (domain:vintage.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
LDAP        10.129.102.227  389    dc01.vintage.htb [-] vintage.htb\P.Rosa:Rosaisbest123 STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED
```

And `LDAP` did not work either. But, this does not necessarily mean that the credentials were incorrect, but most likely the target server is hardened and does not support some type of authentication methods.

So, we are going to retry, but this time using `Kerberos`. We just need to add the `-k` flag in the command and also ensure that our local hosts (`/etc/hosts`) file is updated appropriately to resolve `vintage.htb` and `dc01.vintage.htb` to the target's IP Address.

After doing the above,
